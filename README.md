**html5 demos** - self-contained html with inline javascript

**185 bytes - [Synchrony](https://shu1.github.io/demo/185b-synchrony.html)** [[p](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=68917 "pouet.net")]  
My first ever demo submission, for the [synchrony.nyc](http://synchrony.nyc) "nano" compos, 256 byte limit.  
Also a **187 byte [glitch version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/187b-synchrony.html)** [[p](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=68921 "pouet.net")] that was a bug that ended up looking interesting.  
These demos would not have been possible without various tricks learned from [p01.org](http://www.p01.org/minicraft/)

**247 bytes - [Matrix Rain](https://shu1.github.io/demo/247b-matrix.html)** [[p](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=68918 "pouet.net")] [[d](https://www.dwitter.net/d/800 "dwitter.net")]  
The famous digital rain from The Matrix, in sub-256 byte form.  
Also a **208 byte [lo-res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/208b-matrix.html)** that uses the same 300x300 canvas trick as above.  
And a **255 byte [hi-res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/255b-matrix.html)** but doesn't seem to work on mobile browsers.

**240 bytes - [Parallax Rain](https://shu1.github.io/demo/parallax-rain.html)** [[d](https://www.dwitter.net/d/803 "dwitter.net")]  
From the above Matrix Rain demo, changing the sin() to a tan() resulted in a parallax rain effect.  
Also a **203 byte [lo-res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/parallax-rain-lores.html)**.  
And a **246 byte [hi-res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/parallax-rain-hires.html)** but doesn't seem to work on mobile browsers.

**3358 bytes - [Doodle Asteroids](https://shu1.github.io/demo/doodle-asteroids.html)**  
4k demo. A Google doodle that turns into a game when you click. Also works on mobile.

**vertex shader demos** - viewable on **[VertexShaderArt.com](https://www.vertexshaderart.com)**

**412 bytes - [Synchrony](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/art/SJYTAAwib5eJy8voP)**  
A port of the above html5 demo to vertex shaders. They use the same math, but the results look quite different.

**119 bytes - [Matrix rain](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/art/4MXkkkQvDcbZT2bmy)**  
An accidental discovery of The Matrix digital rain effect while experimenting with the above Synchrony demo. They actually have similar core logic.
