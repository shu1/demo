**html5 demos** - self-contained html with inline javascript

**183b - [synchrony](https://shu1.github.io/demo/synchrony.html)** [[p](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=68917 "pouet.net")]  
My first ever demo submission, for the [synchrony.nyc](http://synchrony.nyc) "nano" compos, 256b limit.  
Also a **185b [glitch version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/synchrony-glitch.html)** [[p](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=68921 "pouet.net")] that was a bug that ended up looking interesting.  
These demos would not have been possible without various tricks learned from [p01.org](http://www.p01.org/minicraft/)

**239b - [matrix rain](https://shu1.github.io/demo/matrix-rain.html)** [[p](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=68918 "pouet.net")] [[d](https://www.dwitter.net/d/1199 "dwitter.net")]  
The famous digital rain from The Matrix, under 256b.  
Also a **203b [lo-res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/matrix-rain-lores.html)** that uses the same 300x300 canvas trick as above.  
And a **246b [hi-res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/matrix-rain-hires.html)** but doesn't run on mobile browsers.

**238b - [sin city](https://shu1.github.io/demo/sin-city.html)** [[d](https://www.dwitter.net/d/1200 "dwitter.net")]  
From the above matrix rain demo, changing the sin() to a tan() resulted in a parallax rain effect.  
Also a **203b [lo-res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/sin-city-lores.html)**.  
And a **246b [hi-res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/sin-city-hires.html)** but doesn't run on mobile browsers.

**913b - [sin city 1k](https://shu1.github.io/demo/sin-city-1k.html)** [[j](http://js1k.com/2017-magic/demo/2900 "js1k.com")]  
An evolution of the above sin city 256b demo for [JS1k 2017](http://js1k.com/2017-magic/).  
Click to switch between 4 modes.

**3500b - [doodleroids](https://shu1.github.io/demo/doodleroids.html)** [[p](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=69044 "pouet.net")]  
4k demo. A Google doodle that turns into a game. Also works on mobile.

**vertex shader demos** - viewable on **[VertexShaderArt.com](https://www.vertexshaderart.com)**

**412b - [synchrony](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/art/SJYTAAwib5eJy8voP)**  
A port of the above html5 demo to vertex shaders. Uses the same math, but the results look quite different.

**119b - [matrix rain](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/art/4MXkkkQvDcbZT2bmy)**  
An accidental discovery of The Matrix digital rain effect while experimenting with the above synchrony demo. The core logic is similar.
