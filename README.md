**HTML5 Demos** - self-contained html with inline javascript

##### 185 bytes - [Synchrony](https://shu1.github.io/demo/185b-synchrony.html)
My first ever demo submission, for the [synchrony.nyc](http://synchrony.nyc) "nano" compos, 256 byte limit.  
While developing I also made a **187 byte [glitch version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/187b-synchrony.html)** that looked interesting so I decided to submit that too.  
I couldn't have made these without various tricks I learned from [p01.org](http://www.p01.org/minicraft/)

##### 247 bytes - [Matrix rain](https://shu1.github.io/demo/247b-matrix.html)
The famous digital rain code from The Matrix, in sub-256 byte form.  
Also a **255 byte [high res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/255b-matrix.html)** but doesn't seem to work on mobile browsers.  
And a **208 byte [low res version](https://shu1.github.io/demo/208b-matrix.html)** that uses the 300x300 canvas trick from [p01.org](http://www.p01.org/minicraft/)

##### 412 bytes - [Synchrony](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/art/SJYTAAwib5eJy8voP)
I tried porting the above html5 demo to vertex shaders. It uses much of the same math, but the results were quite different.

##### 119 bytes - [Matrix rain](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/art/4MXkkkQvDcbZT2bmy)
While developing the above Synchrony demo, I came upon The Matrix digital rain code effect. They actually share core logic.
